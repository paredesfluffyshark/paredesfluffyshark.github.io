## 30MFF Web page 
[page link](https://paredesfluffyshark.github.io/com_lab/30MFF.html)

### Project Description: 
This webpage is meant to display the 30MFF video project that was made collaboratively between 4 NYUAD students and was hosted by the Interactive Media Department of NYUAD. In one hour, the randomly grouped students were meant to plan, shoot and edit a quick 2 minute video. It could be about any topic and could be done as creatively as possible. My teams video which I titled *Unique Mundane Items* features my 3 teammates and I passing around seemingly ordinary objects and showcases how even though these items look mundane, theyare unique to us and showcase our individuality. It is a fun and cute video that makes people who watch it smile.

### Process
The video was made to have a lively atmosphere and 'cute' concept with the use of electronic-pop, 8bit styled music that originally came from the game Undertale. In addition, the website itself uses a light blue color theme that emphasises the child-like feel of the video. Finally, the use of illustrated images (the team images) and the interactivity of the members shooting 'peace signs' add another level to the charming appeal of the video paired with the website.

### Reflection/Evaluation
I think that I did a good job of matching the feel of the short film to the wesite. I do wish my code were cleaner. As I continue in this project I hope to seperate my styling CSS sheets into specific sheets that corespond to the web page they style. (For example making separate styling sheets for the homepage, the comlab page, the 30MFF page etc) so that my class and ID names don't get too long and confusing. Though makign the page itself was quite taxing, I am satisfied with the resuts.
