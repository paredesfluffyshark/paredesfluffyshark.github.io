					<div class = "text_content"> Quim Paredes is currently a 3rd Year student of NYUAD. She works in many different media, though mainly with acrylic. She is interested in art that accurately expresses her own emotions and mental state. Though previously she focused on making art that does not reflect any part of her, she has reccently taken interest in her identity, what it means to be in her body, and her thoughts. </div>

					<div class = "text_title"> PROJECT DESCRIPTION </div>
					<div class = "text_content">  Quim has always been interested in exploring her own seemingly abnormal mental and physical experiences and trying to capture their essence in the form of characters. These pieces compiled in the portfolio titled "Casted" portray a total of four characters who were shaped from Quim methodically writing down a daily journal entry daily and discerning ideas from these. This portfolio consists of a series of character sheets, GIFs and digital paintings in an attempt to capture the essence of the characters that Quim made. When creating these characters she made a multitude sketches, but only 4 made the cut. Though the characters were initially made from her thought patterns, as she created the final pieces they blossomed into an exploration of the character themselves and how they are a refraction of Quim rather than a reflection. As a result, through the learning who these characters are, Quim became a director, selecting her actors in the movie of her mental space.  </div>
